# Clustering-and-Frequent-Pattern-Mining-on-a-bank-card-transaction
In this project, we used  bank card transaction data to cluster users based on their spending behaviors using the K-means method. Also, we utilized the frequent pattern mining to discover patterns of frequently co-occurring transaction types

Here's a summary of the key tasks:

## 1) Clustering Analysis:

-  The task involves clustering users based on their spending behaviors using the K-means method. The assignment requires determining the appropriate number of clusters, denoted as "K," for the K-means algorithm. You must also explain how features are created and interpret the meaning of each resultant cluster. Furthermore, assess the quality of the obtained clusters.
- Following the clustering analysis in previous point, you need to report the statistics of loyalty scores for each cluster of users and provide your findings.
- Decide if the dimension reduction is necessary to enhance clustering performance or not. If you believe that dimension reduction would be beneficial, you can apply it or opt for an alternative clustering method. The task is to explain why the resulting clusters in this step are better than those obtained in previous point.

## 2) Frequent Pattern Mining:
- Utilize frequent pattern mining to discover patterns of frequently co-occurring transaction types. Report your findings and justify the selection of the minimum support threshold for mining these patterns.

- Revisit the frequent pattern mining (as in Q5) but this time, split users based on their loyalty scores. The goal is to explore if different frequent patterns exist in users with high and low loyalty scores.


# Summary :
In summary, this assignment involves exploring user behavior through clustering analysis, dimension reduction, and frequent pattern mining to gain insights into loyalty scores and transaction types. It requires making informed decisions about the methodology and thresholds used in each analysis.
